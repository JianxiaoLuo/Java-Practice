# Java-Practice
This is a repository for reviewing and practicing Java. I decide not to run away from now on! It has been a long time that I stayed away from Java and focus only on Python, cause I thought changing programming language can solve all my problems, which is wrong obviously. Now I am ganna face challenges eventually!
